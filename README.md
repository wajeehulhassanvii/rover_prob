little issue with second rover,,,,,,,\n
simply run '''''python main.py''''' to run the program, \nto run the tests run the command '''''python -m unittest -v tests/(test_rover/test_plateau/test_position).py''''' while running tests, run either test_rover or test_plateau or test_position alone, don't run them together
